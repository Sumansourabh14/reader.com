# Observations

## Cookies (Headache!!!!)

- The token is coming in the cookies section under the Applications tab in dev console but the react code is not getting that.
  - There are 4 key value pairs in which the token is generated when the user logs in.
  - But React code doesn't recognise that. It only sees the first 3 pairs that were already present.
